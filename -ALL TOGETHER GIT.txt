				Open Repository

Be sure you are in your project directory

git init          # Opened a repository. You can show .git file in your directory by ls -a

				Carry to Local Area

git add urfile.txt          # it is in tracked file. So ready to commit
git add .                   # all files in this directory are in tracked file
git rm --cached urfile.txt  # it is removed from tracked file. it is in untracked file anymore
git satatus                 # u can see urfile in tracked or untracked file

				Carry to Station Area

git commit -m "first commit"  # tracked files carried to station area. u can write a message by -n
git log                       # shows commit details. commit id, author, date
git log --online              # result shows in oneline

if u do changes in urfile u ll see that; modified:urfile.txt in untracked file, u have to carry it to station area again by git add.

Ä°f u do another commit, log gives u another version.

				Version Control

git log --oneline            # u should choose version and copy version id
git reset versionid --hard   # if u use --hard flag, u will all versions after this version
git reset versionid --soft   # version ll be in local area then u ll commit and u can use this version again

git revert versionid         # committed changes deleted.

git commit --amend -m "edited comment"   # u can edit comment by --amend

git branch feature          # named feature branch created.
git checkout feature        # Switched to brach 'feature'

git checkout -b feature-2   # named feature-2 branch created and switched.

NOTE: if u r on master branch when u r creating branch, branch will connect to master.
So be careful that u wanna create branch that connect to where and where r u now.


git branch -d feature-2     # delete feature-2 branch. if u have error then u can use -D instead of -d
