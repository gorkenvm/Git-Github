			Create,Switch and Delete Branch

git branch feature          # named feature branch created.
git checkout feature        # Switched to brach 'feature'

git checkout -b feature-2   # named feature-2 branch created and switched.

NOTE: if u r on master branch when u r creating branch, branch will connect to master.
So be careful that u wanna create branch that connect to where and where r u now.


git branch -d feature-2     # delete feature-2 branch. if u have error then u can use -D instead of -d
